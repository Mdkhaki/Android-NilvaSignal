## Introduction
We want you to add a feature to [signal app messanger](https://github.com/signalapp). It is pretty simple, make @nilva mentions customized! if "@nilva" is sent in chat message, put nilva icon to right side of "@nilva" text in chat bubble (it must be inside text), also when clicked on it, send your distance from our company location (35.703065, 51.348105) as a chat message.


## Expectations

So What does matter to us?
- ability to understand other people's code
